      <h1>Our goal</h1>
      <p>
         Here at We-Support we hope to educate users by teaching them about what environmentally<br>
         safe practices their favorite companies are (or aren't!) using. We also provide information on what<br>
         stances companies are taking in social justice issues.
      
      </p>
      <h2>Why this matters
         </h2>
         <p2>We must work together to gain a better understanding of eachother and this planet that we call home.<br>
              Hopefully, this site will help you see which businesses you should be giving your business to,<br>
              to encourage whatever good practices that the company is implementing.
