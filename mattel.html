        <p>Although Mattel is doing a great deal to use recycled<br> materials in their packaging,
        they could choose to eliminate all plastic from their<br> products in the way that Hasbro is doing.
    Their site says the folowing: "Achieved 97.9% recycled or <br>FSC-certified content in the paper and wood
    fiber used in our products and packaging in 2021, as validated<br> by the Rainforest Alliance.
    Increased the amount of recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate)<br> in most of our window cartons 
    and blister packs from 25% in 2020 to 30% in 2021."<br> https://corporate.mattel.com/sustainable-product-and-packaging
